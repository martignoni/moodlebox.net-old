You may find the version of your MoodleBox by visiting the MoodleBox dashboard:Â <a href="http://moodlebox.home/admin/tool/moodlebox/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Site administration > Server > MoodleBox</a> in the administration interface.

This info is only available since MoodleBox version 1.9.5 of 1 November 2017.
