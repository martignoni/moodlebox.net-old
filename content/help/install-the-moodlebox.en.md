This is the procedure to install the MoodleBox for its first utilisation.

### Step 1: Buy the hardware

The [stuff you will need][1] to build your MoodleBox is essentially a Raspberry Pi (preferably a model B3) with a power supply and a MicroSD card. [More information here][1].

### Step 2: Download the MoodleBox disk image

The [MoodleBox disk image][2] is available [here][2].

### Step 3: Copy the disk image on your MicroSD card

For this operation, use preferably [Etcher][10]. [More information here][3].

### Step 4: Startup your MoodleBox

Insert your microSD card into the Raspberry Pi 3 slot, power it up and connect it to the network via anÂ Ethernet cable. The red LED lights up, and after a few seconds the green LED lights up intermittently.

There is no other manipulation to do: after the boot, your MoodleBox is ready and totally functional.

### Next steps

  * [Access to Moodle][4]
  * [Wi-Fi connection][5] and [configuration][6]
  * [SSH access][7] to the MoodleBox
  * [Support the MoodleBox project][8]
