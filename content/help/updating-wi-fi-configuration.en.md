### Change Wi-Fi network name (SSID)

You may change the network name (SSID). Type in a new SSID in the adequate field and click the button __Change Wi-Fi setting__.

### Change Wi-Fi access point channel

To change the Wi-Fi channel of the access point of the MoodleBox, select a channel number and click the button __Change Wi-Fi setting__.

### Remove Wi-Fi network password or change it

To enable a easier access of the Wi-Fi access point of the MoodleBox, it's possible to allow its access without a password. To do this, uncheck the "Wi-Fi network password protected" checkbox. This can be rechecked at anytime.

It is also possible to change the password of the Wi-Fi access point of the MoodleBox. To do this, type in a new password in the adequate field. The password should be 8 to 63 characters long. If you fail to input a valid password, it will be reverted to the default password "moodlebox".
