The MoodleBox is a small footprint mobile device, Internet independent, providing a wireless network for your smartphone, tablet or computer. It provides a complete [Moodle][1] learning management system platform, enabling to supply online learning activities and sharing files with your users.

When connected to the Internet via a wired network (Ethernet), the MoodleBox also provides Internet access to devices connected to it via Wi-Fi.

It is [built][2] around a mini-computer [Raspberry Pi 3][3] and the [Moodle learning environment][1], the most used open source LMS in the world.

### The MoodleBox project

The MoodleBox project is a free (as in speech and in beer) project. The idea of MoodleBox arose in spring 2016 in a forum discussion [in the french community of Moodle][4], when discussing about the construction of a [Moodle platform on a local computer][5], to provide an LMS in regions without any network infrastructure. The [idea quickly emerged][6] to build it with a Raspberry Pi 3, and to make it accessible via Wi-Fi. Thanks to the perseverance of [Christian Westphal][7], a [first proof of concept][8] was proposed.

The MoodleBox project is made by [Nicolas Martignoni][9] on his spare time.
