Here is the stuff you will need to build your MoodleBox:

  * [Raspberry Pi 3][1],
  * [Power supply][2],
  * [MicroSD card][3], 32 GB (minimum),
  * [Raspberry Pi case][4] (not essential, but very useful to protect the Raspberry Pi 3).

The total hardware amount is approximately USD 90, 80 € or CHF 90.
