On your device, choose __MoodleBox__ wireless network. When prompted type the password: __moodlebox__ (all lowercase) and confirm your connection.

Youâ€™re now connected on the Wi-Fi network, and you can access to the Moodle environment via your browser, using the following address: http://moodlebox.home/. The home page of your Moodle will now display.
