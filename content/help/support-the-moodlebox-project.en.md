The project MoodleBox tries to meet the needs of users without requiring any financial compensation. However, the development and maintenance of the MoodleBox, the building of the disk image, the writing of theÂ documentation and its hosting on a web site are not free.

A contribution, totally optional, allows to participate in the costs for the hosting of the website. It boosts and increases the motivation to continue the work on the project MoodleBox.

As of december 19, 2017, the project MoodleBox collected 235â‚¬ in donations. This amount enabled the payment of the subscription fees for the domain names:Â moodlebox.net, moodlebox.org, moodlebox.me, moodlebox.fr, moodlebox.de and moodlebox.ch, as well as the web hosting subscriptionÂ for one year.
