The MoodleBox provides a [Moodle][1] learning management system outside of any network infrastructure, by using a small, cheap and versatile device.

It's used to enhance online learning and teaching:

  * where infrastructure is non-existent or inadequate;
  * where infrastructure has been destroyed (war);
  * when existing infrastructure is not suitable for specific projects.

It offers small groups (about 20-30 participants) the opportunity to work in a learning environment without the need for heavy setup.
