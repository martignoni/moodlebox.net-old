In order to improve loading performance and ensure better security, the MoodleBox project website has been completely rewritten. It now uses [Hugo][3], a [static site generator][1], instead of the [WordPress CMS][2]. Using a static site generator has several advantages over the use of a CMS, including

- The website is more efficient and very fast to display for users,
- The maintenance of the web server is much simpler, since there is no dynamic language or database; we gain in robustness and resilience,
- There are no security problems related to dynamic languages or databases.

In terms of functionalities, there is no change for users, even if the layout has been adapted.
