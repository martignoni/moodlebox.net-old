In order to improve loading performance and ensure better security, the MoodleBox project website has been completely rewritten. It now uses [static site technology][1] instead of the [WordPress CMS][2]. This technology has several advantages over the use of a CMS, including

- The website is more efficient and very fast to display for users.
- The maintenance of the web server is much simpler, since there is no dynamic language or database; we gain in robustness and resilience.
- There are no security problems related to dynamic languages or databases.

In terms of functionalities, there is no change for users.
