Since yesterday, MoodleBox has been used at the penitentiary centre in Caen.

The main difficulty in delivering quality education in prisons is the lack of Internet access. In the digital age, when university students take advantage of the content available on the Internet, in particular that of universities, Caen's inmates were once again almost reduced to having to browse their courses on handouts, since in detention, the web is simply banned.

From now on, prisoners who so wish will have access to the same course contents as those of the university.
